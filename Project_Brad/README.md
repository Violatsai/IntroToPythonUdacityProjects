# Project: Brad

Project Brad utilizes the built-in library "turtle" from Python, which allows us to create a turtle on a GUI and manipulate it. In this specific project, I used a while loop to control the turtle named Brad to draw a beautiful geometric pattern. 

To run it, make sure you have __python2__  installed, and simply run the following command in your terminal:
<pre>
python Brad.py
</pre>
and enjoy!
