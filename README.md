# PythonPractice

This is the first github repo of Viola Tsai! I am a master's student with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who is passionate about programming as a localization translator!

I started learning python from Sept. 2018. This repo contains the files I wrote as practice when taking _Introduction to Python_ on Udacity. The project of the largest scale is __Project: TakeABreak__, which is able to read arguments from the user on the terminal. __Project: Brad__ is a cute demo of while loop using a turtle named Brad that draws beautiful geometric shapes!
